We aim to cover 10 different scenarios!.

This notebook was prepared as part of a Python study group organized by the good folks at [Boston Python](https://about.bostonpython.com/). 

Wherever I used external sources, I made an honest effort to refer to them, but if I have made any errors or omitted any original sources, please let me know.

I hope you find this material (and honestly the fun math to go with it,) curious, in your ventures.

Cheers!
