# `itertools_presentation`

I'm planning to go through the notebook as my presentation. At the beginning, I will cover the three key locations to find the resource documentation for itertools.

I'm working on grouping the discussion based on _scenarios_, so this way, I can talk about itertools and more_itertools in the same section. 

# `itertools_exercises`

I already have a 2D example that I can put here. I'm planning to say that, likely, for this kind of thing, it would be best to use standard tools like scikit-image, but this is a demonstration of what's possible.

The Real Python article on itertools [here](https://realpython.com/python-itertools/) has some excellent documentation on this that I plan on stressing for folks to go look. For me, I was thinking of modifying the Fib example to logistic map, and show how easily one can get into chaotic behavior with a seemingly benign mapping.

For a time-series data example, my fall-back is S&P data, but I should be able to gather a couple of stress-strain curves to give the folks a flavor of how something like this gets applied in materials world.
